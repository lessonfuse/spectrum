1. Introduction
This guide is designed to provide assistance in developing an individualized curriculum
plan (ICP) mentioned in the Inclusive Education Policy (2021).
Since the ICP is designed for individual students, the plan will help teachers, parents,
school administrators, and those associated with the student's learning to work together in
an effective way to advance the student's learning.
2. Purpose
The purpose of preparing this guide is as follows:
• Engage teachers of students with complex learning profiles, their parents, and all
stakeholders in the student's learning
• To educate students as per Inclusive Education Policy (2021) and National
Curriculum Framework (2015)
• Establishing strong teaching guidelines for students with complex learning
profiles.
• Helping students reach their maximum potential in their learning
3. Pre-preparation of an ICP
In order to systematically develop the Individualized Curriculum Plan (ICP), it is
important to accurately identify the student and diligently gather comprehensive
information about the student.
3.1 Student being flagged
If any delays or differences may be noted by the class teacher compared to other students
of the age group (in terms of growth and learning skills), the class teacher should inform
the inclusive support unit through the referral system established in the school. When
referring in this way, it is advisable to use the referral form used in the school. Similarly,
if the student and the parent also need support, teacher can submit it in writing to the
school's support unit or to the school's SEN teacher if there is no support unit. However,
the student's need for ICP in an official form will be decided by the school inclusion
committee after making observations at the school level or within the school support unit.
4
3.2 Evaluation to identify the student
In case of suspected difficulties or delays, observations can be made. After that,
complete the comprehensive checklist, designed by the Department of Inclusive
Education, to ascertain the student's current developmental stage.
In order to support the student's learning, use the previously mentioned checklist to
observe and assess the student. This evaluation should ideally involve three lessons, each
conducted by different teachers (leading teacher, class teacher, subject teacher). These
observations should be conducted without any discussions among the three teachers.
Should the parent require further clarification, the parent can consider seeking an
additional assessment or diagnosis from a specialized professional.
3.3 Inclusion Committee
The committee’s decisions must be in the best interest of the student. Therefore, by
relying on the committee's counsel, the most fitting inclusive program for the student can
be determined, leading to the formulation of an Individualized Curriculum Plan (ICP). It
is advised that the ICP team be tasked with devising the plan based on optimal strategies
for the student's benefit.
At the time of submission of the student's case to the committee, all documents related to
the student (observation, assessment report and checklists) should be submitted.
3.4 ICP team
The team is responsible for formulating the Individualized Curriculum Plans (ICPs) for
students, with the active involvement of the student's parent. The establishment of the
student's learning objectives will involve collaboration with subject teachers across all
areas that contribute to the student's education.
4. To consider when developing the ICP
• Thoroughly familiarize yourself with any submitted student-related documents.
• The current level should be assessed based on classroom observations, tests, and
assessments designed to identify student.
• Based on the information gathered, the student's competencies should be assessed
after discussion with the team.
• Engage the student's parent to solicit insights for advancing the student's
developmental and educational progress.
• Identify and arrange supplementary school-based activities to further enrich the
student's experience and identify suitable activities that align with the student's
capabilities for their active participation.

5. Key Sections of the ICP Include:
5.1 Student's Personal Information Section:
In this section, the student's personal information, as well as the parent’s concerns about
the student, should be written. Additionally, health-related considerations such as existing
medical conditions (e.g., fits, shortness of breath, and information on medications being
used) or important family issues (e.g., speech impairments of family members, separation
of parents) must be written in this section in the ICP.
5.2 Student evaluation summary
If the student has a diagnosed condition (with the related documents), please note it on
the checklist. Also, make a mark on the parts that raise concerns based on observations
while completing the referral form. Remember to gather and file all necessary documents.
5.3 Assessing the extent to which skills required for growth and learning are delayed
If there is a delay in any stage of the student's development, mark it in terms of the
specific type(s) of growth involved. If the student has delayed learning, the extent of the
delay should be recorded.
5.4 Current level of skill, ability/educational level of the student
In this section, record the student's proficiencies, interests, life skills, and the skill and
scope of their capabilities in significant domains. Evaluate the student's performance and
caliber in various subjects, quantifying and detailing both their proficiency and quality.
Distinguish any differences compared to peers of the same age group.
5.5 Current level of education
Document the student's academic strengths, areas of interest, unique traits, and personal
achievements. Additionally, provide an overview of the current level of knowledge and
progress in various subjects and skills, including life skills. This should encompass the
degree of cognitive functioning, how frequently proficiency is demonstrated, patterns of
learning, and the expected rate of improvement in grasping information.
5.6 Conducive learning environment
List all necessary environmental modifications that should be implemented according to
the student's circumstances. Include all relevant settings and tools utilized to enhance the
student's skills and capabilities (e.g., classroom, recreational area, seating arrangement, or
play materials). This section should comprehensively detail the requisite adjustments and
provisions.
6
Elaborate on any supplementary assistance employed for instructing the student, such as
the extent of assignments given, variations in font sizes, and distinct components utilized.
Include meticulous details. If external assistance is required, document the specific
instances, along with the duration and frequency of assistance required.
5.7 Specific Directives
Indicate the originating Key Stage from which the teaching content is sourced.
If you need to use a variety of methods to teach the student, you should explain how to
proceed. In addition, it should be noted which of the programs included in the policy is
most appropriate for the student.
Finally, the changes that need to be made in the examination and assessment should be
written according to the student's circumstances. (E.g., giving more time and providing
additional assistance in case of writing difficulties)
5.8 Setting yearly goals
Five areas of the curriculum should be taken into account while setting annual goals.
Goals should be based on the outcome or indicator drawn from the curriculum.
This outcome or indicator should be derived from the core competencies (which can be
derived from different grades as well) depending on the student's ability.
It is important to explain as much as possible in writing goals (e.g.: 'At the end of the first
term, Ahmed will say two-letter words').
There should also be a minimum and maximum number of criteria to be achieved. (E.g.:
Ahmed should write minimum/maximum)
The methods used to achieve the goal or outcome should be documented.
The level of goal assessment, the way the goal is planned, and the assessment schedule
should be determined.
5.9 Integrating Checklist with Class:
If the mainstream teacher takes too many outcomes, they should be written on a separate
sheet and those outcomes or goals should be attached under each subject.
5.10 Additional Support Services provided to the student:
If a student takes any additional service in the school or outside of school (e.g.,
counseling, physiotherapy, speech therapy), details of that service should be written. The
type, time and duration of the service should be recorded. It is recommended to provide 
7
pertinent documents and actively participate in relevant meetings to ensure effective
coordination.
5.11 Information about ICP team participants
It holds significant importance to ensure that the participant information, date, and
signature of the ICP team members are fully provided in the ICP. These sections are
pivotal for the ICP to be deemed a comprehensive document. This is primarily due to the
crucial role that the ICP plays in facilitating the student's continuous learning journey.
The dates incorporated within the ICP must be meticulously recorded. These include the
school admission date, the initial ICP meeting date, the commencement date of the ICP,
as well as the dates of subsequent reviews. The active involvement of the parent in the
formulation of the ICP is essential, and their signature is a requisite component of the
process.
6. Transition Services:
This concept pertains to the transition process when a student progresses from one phase
to another within the classroom, school environment, and broader life context.
These activities encompass the methods through which a student advances from one stage
to another, while concurrently honing life skills. To adequately equip students for their
future, it's essential to establish a robust framework that seamlessly integrates the
learning journey with eventual employability.
7. Planning for transition:
A transition strategy tailored to students with complex learning profiles should be
established for their movement between different educational stages or schools, and this
plan should be shared with relevant parties.
Furthermore, vocational education providers should collaborate closely with parents to
cultivate the student's interests, identify necessary areas of growth, and develop pertinent
skills as they transition from Key Stage 2. (When 6th grade concludes and moves to 7th
grade).
When students reach the end of Key Stage 3, and when they are ready to transition from
student life to employment, a transition plan should be developed based on their
individual interests.
Note: Students' transition plan should be attached with the ICPs.
8
8. Instructional Approach Aligned with the ICP:
Once all the elements of the ICP have been finalized, it's essential for all teachers to come
together and collaborate in order to attain the goals outlined in the ICP.
9. Reviewing ICP:
Each student's ICP should undergo a minimum of two reviews annually. During these
reviews, an assessment should be conducted to determine the degree to which the
established goals have been accomplished. Based on whether the objectives have been
met or not, necessary adjustments should be implemented, and efforts should
recommence towards attaining the ICP goals.
10.Conclusion:
With this aid, teachers will be able to develop ICPs. ICP is necessary for any student
requiring extra help in an educational setting. The provided guidelines will assist teachers
in proactively addressing issues before and during the development of ICPs.
