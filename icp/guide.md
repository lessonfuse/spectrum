# ICP Document Generation for Django Application

## Overview
The ICP (Individualized Care Plan) document is designed to automate the creation of a comprehensive educational profile for students. This document includes various sections that capture essential information about the studentâ€™s educational needs, strengths, and support requirements. The following outlines each page of the document, detailing the necessary fields and structure for automation.


## Suggested packages
- python-docx: For generating Word documents programmatically.
- django-crispy-forms: For styling and rendering Django forms.
- docxtpl: For template-based document generation.
- tailwindcss: For styling the document templates.
- django-storages: For managing static files and media storage.

## Suggested aproach
- Allow storage of the ICP data in a Django model.
- Allow storage of student data for easy retrieval and updating.

## Implementation Notes
- Each section should be designed to allow for easy data entry and retrieval.
- Ensure that the document can be generated in a user-friendly format (e.g., PDF) for distribution.
- Consider validation rules for required fields to ensure completeness of the document.
- Implement user roles to manage access to sensitive information.

This structured approach will facilitate the automation of the ICP document generation, ensuring that all necessary information is captured efficiently and accurately.
